When operating heimdall in Decision Operation Mode exposing Envoy’s external authorization GRPC protocol, integration with Contour can be achieved by creating an ExtensionService resource for heimdall and either an HTTPProxy resource for the upstream service, referencing the aforesaid ExtensionService, or configure Contour to use it globally (for all routes).</description></item><item><title>Emissary Ingress Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/emissary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 15:23:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/emissary/</guid><description>Emissary-Ingress is an Envoy-powered open source, high performance ingress controller and API Gateway for Kubernetes from Ambassador Labs.
When operating heimdall in Decision Operation Mode, integration with Emissary-Ingress can be achieved by creating an AuthService resource for heimdall. If you’re using the commercial Ambassador Edge Stack, you have to use the External Filter instead, which spec is more or less identical to the AuthService resource referenced above. In both cases the underlying Envoy proxy will be configured to delegate authentication and authorization of all incoming requests for all routes to heimdall.</description></item><item><title>Envoy Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/envoy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 00:13:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/envoy/</guid><description>Envoy is a high performance distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and “universal data plane” designed for large microservice “service mesh” architectures. When operating heimdall in Decision Operation Mode, integration with Envoy can be achieved by making use of an External Authorization filter. In such setup, Envoy delegates authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 200 OK HTTP code, Envoy grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service.</description></item><item><title>HAProxy Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/haproxy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2023 07:32:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/haproxy/</guid><description>HAProxy (High Availability Proxy) is a popular open source, fast, and reliable solution providing load balancer and reverse proxy features for TCP- and HTTP-based applications, capable handling heavy load traffic and rerouting requests seamlessly across multiple workloads (e.g. web, application, database).
HAProxy is highly extensible thanks to Lua scripting support. For that reason the vanilla HAProxy does not implement any means of external authorization support and requires custom Lua code to achieve integration with heimdall.</description></item><item><title>NGINX Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/nginx/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:14:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/nginx/</guid><description>NGINX is an HTTP and reverse proxy server which became famous as one of the fastest web servers out there, heimdall can be integrated with by making use of the ngx_http_auth_request_module. In such setup, NGINX delegates authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 2XX code, NGINX grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. If heimdall returns 401 or 403, the access is denied with the corresponding error code.</description></item><item><title>Traefik Proxy Integration</title><link>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/traefik/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 18:59:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dadrus.github.io/guides/proxies/traefik/</guid><description>Traefik Proxy is a modern HTTP proxy and load balancer for microservices, heimdall can be integrated with via the ForwardAuth Middleware while operated in the Decision Operation Mode. In such setup, traefik delegates authentication and authorization to heimdall. If heimdall answers with a 2XX code, traefik grants access and forwards the original request to the upstream service. Otherwise, the response from heimdall is returned to the client.
To achieve this, configure traefik</description></item></channel></rss>
